# homotopy-jailbreak
This repo contains the evaluation for an anon EMNLP submission.

## Prerequisite
We first create a conda environment and then install some necessary packages:

```conda create -n homotopy python=3.11.8```

```conda activate homotopy```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Model fine tuning
We use [huggingface SFT Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/sft_trainer) to fine tune the model.

To fine-tune the model, one can run

```python ft.py --model_path LLAMA_PATH --model llama```

The base model can be either [Llama-2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf/tree/main) or [zephyr_7b_r2d2](https://huggingface.co/cais/zephyr_7b_r2d2).

We use ```--model_path``` to specify where the base model is stored and ```--model``` (the option is either ```llama``` or ```zep```) to specify the type of the model. 

One can also change the fine-tuning batch size using flag ```--batch_size``` and also ```--epochs``` to specify how many epochs are desired for the fine-tuning. 

```--check_steps``` is used to specify how frequently the model checkpoint is saved. In this project, we use LoRA fine-tuning to tune the base model. By default, the LoRA checkpoint adapters are saved in ```./adapter``` directory.
```
To download the base models from hugging face, there are two options:
1. [Recommended] Install git-lfs. Then, git clone the huggingface url of the model at the desired PATH.
2. Specify the desired path via the HF_HOME env variable.
```
## Running H-GCG and H-AutoDAN
Run the appropriate bash script for a given model and method, found in `h-gcg` and `h-autodan`. You can modify the GPU device, finetuned model path, base model path and judge model path in the `.sh` script itself. By default, the script will run homotopy attacks over checkpoints 600->200->100->40 and then finally the base model.

```
bash run_hgcg_llama.sh
```
This will run H-GCG on 1 example for the specified finetuned model, base model and judge. 
```
bash run_hautodan_llama.sh
```
This will run H-AutoDAN on 1 example for the specified finetuned model, base model and judge.

1. `DEVICE` changes the GPU device used.
2. `FINETUNED_MODEL_PATH` should point to the directory containing checkpoints obtained from finetuning.
3. `BASE_MODEL_PATH` should point to the base model directory (either Llama-2-7b-chat-hf or Zephyr-R2D2).
4. `JUDGE_PATH` should point to the [HarmBench judge model](https://huggingface.co/cais/HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls).
5. `END` controls how many samples are included in the run, starting from index 0.

The final output for H-GCG (and H-AutoDAN) will be a json file saved in `data/llama2` or `data/zephyr`, in the following format:

1. `completions`: is a list with the completions to adversarial inputs.
2. `tasks`: is a list of harmful instructions from AdvBench.
3. `goals`: is a list of target completions used as part of GCG and AutoDAN
4. `iterations`: is a list of the total iterations (iteration index) taken to find a jailbreak for every task.
5. `losses`: is a list of lists, where each element list tracks the change in loss for a given prompt as the suffix is optimized.
6. `adv_strings`: is a list of adversarial suffixes that either succeeded or failed at the end of available iterations.

The output for H-AutoDAN will be identical, with an additional field `adv_string_pop`, which is a list of lists, containing the 256 candidate suffixes at the last iteration for each input prompt.

You can change which checkpoints are being used by modifying the scripts. Note that you might have to change `gcg_warm_start_path` in the H-GCG config files, or `WARM_START_PATH` in the H-AutoDAN `.sh` scripts as well.
